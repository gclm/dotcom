Tags are created by typing `#` followed by a tag name anywhere in a memo.

## Examples

```markdown
#work
#project-alpha
#meeting-notes
#memos/issue
#memos/pull-request
```

## Tips

- Use lowercase and hyphens for consistency.
- Keep tags short and descriptive.
- Reuse the same tag names to make filtering easier.
- Use slashes (/) to create tag hierarchies for better organization.
